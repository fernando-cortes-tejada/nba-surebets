"""Arbitrage math for decimal odds.

A set of mutually exclusive, exhaustive outcomes (over/under, team A/team B)
priced at decimal odds o_1..o_n is an arbitrage when the implied
probabilities sum to less than one:

    S = sum(1 / o_i) < 1

Staking each outcome in proportion to its implied probability,
stake_i = B * (1 / o_i) / S, pays the same B / S whichever outcome wins,
so the guaranteed return on the bankroll B is 1 / S - 1.
